# Implementation required

### archive path configuration
- add path with archives
- register all archives from the selected path
- display list of the registred archives in current configuration
- check that registed files exists in the path
- switching between configuration. e.g.: for home PC archives placed in ~/library/lib.rus.ec on notebook in ~/workspace/fb2lib/books etc.
 

### archive handlers
- loading existing perple into "do not insert" set when collecting authors from archives
